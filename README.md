# HomeWork#2: Create a Portfolio

## Project Description:
In this project, I created my web portfolio.
The idea is to consolidate in a web page all my work expereience and knowledge.

## Table of Content:
1. Main Menu (hamburger button that opens when clicked)
1. Introduction (my picture with name and profession)
1. My work expereince (with a mechanical blue print as background image)
1. Who I am (a breif description of myself)
1. My work (Images that has my github projects as URLs linked to them)

## What I Learned:
In this project I learned about CSS.
As a beginer, it is really important for me to learn the bases of what a Web Page style must have.
Also, it is really intresting how to create features such as:
- The hamburger button.
- How to display the menu with a click
- How to link a URL to an image
- How to define colors as variables
- How to set the cursor evidencers just like an image increasing size when the cursor hovers over it.
